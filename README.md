# Rolling-dice-game

Rolling dice is a fun game where two players play by rolling two dices and the first to reach the score they set before the game is the winner.

## Rules of the game
- Before the game starts players must set the winning score for the game or else the winning score will be 100 by default, so whoever gets 100 first is the winner.
- When a player is rolling the dices he/she can choose to hold so that their current score is counted.
- if a player roll and one or both dices land on one, the player looses his/her current score and its the next players turn to play.
